IOT based smart agricultural and alerting system is designed to help the Agriculture officers and farmers for improving the productivity. It help to perform soil test, check environmental parameters like temperature, humidity, soil nutrients, PH, rain etc. The system architecture is composed of two layers, front end and back end layer. 
The front end layer of our monitoring system is hardware module which is designed to collect the measurements of ten environmental attributes using six sensing devices and send them wirelessly to a remote host. 
The hardware module is solar powered. There is a backup; the battery is able to supply the module for two successive days.For field parameters model SVM classifier is used for 
classification of data. It uses a technique called kernel trick to transform data and then based on these transformation it find an optimal boundary between the possible output. This platform is designed for both farmers and officers to reduce field visit. This system is easy portable, eco-friendly and cost effective. 
Further enhancement: Develop multiple 
plant diseases where the software architecture can handle different plant disease models or other precision agriculture applications. So the system is capable of automatically suggesting whether farmer apply fungicide or not and early prediction of parameter change.
